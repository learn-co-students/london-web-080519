# Level: Hard

## Deliverables

You are building the next big crowdfunding site. Users can make projects and
fund projects. Oh the projects!

- your models are users, projects and pledges
  - a project will have a pledge goal amount
  - a user can both create and back projects, so a user will have multiple
    connections to projects based on those different roles

Write out the relationships using has_many, belongs_to and has_many_through.
Write out a schema that shows what these tables might look like in a database.
Where would the foreign keys live? Then *build out methods reflecting all these
relationships.* What method can I call on a user to find other users who have
backed his/her projects, etc?

#### User

- .highest_pledge
  - returns the user who has made the highest pledge
- .multi_pledger
  - returns all users who have pledged to multiple projects
- .project_creator
  - returns all users who have created a project

#### Project

- .no_pledges
  - returns all projects which have no pledges yet
- .above_goal
  - returns all projects which have met or exceeded their pledge goal
- .most_backers
  - returns the project with the highest number of backers

#### Pledge
